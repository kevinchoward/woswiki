1. In order for the webOS emulator to access the local development server,
   right-click the project, select Properties, then Run/Debug Settings.  Select
   the run configuration woswiki and click the Edit button.  Go to the Arguments
   tab.  In the Program Arguments box you should see:
      --port=8888 C:\PalmWorkspace\woswiki\war
   ...where the path points to your workspace.  Add to this:
      --address=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
   ...where aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd is the IP address of your local machine.  You
   should then be able to access the development server via IP address instead
   of just localhost, and this should work from the emulator as well.
